# Overview

This is a currency convert exchange rate. The rates are updated daily with the API.

The interface is simple but accomplishes its purpose to convert currencies. The application is using a simple HTML and CSS, but the main functionalities are all using Javascript.

The purpose for writing the software is to improve coding skills and mastering more the Javascript language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
